## Section 8: Functional Programming

### What is Functional Programming?

This is a style of programming where solutions are isolated, simple and independent of other components of the application

They key features of functional programming is:

1) Isolated functions - no dependence of the state of the program

2) Pure functions - output is always the same for any given input

3) Limited side effects

### Callbacks

A callback is a function passed into another function

First class functions are functions which are assigned to a variable, passed to another function or returned from another function

Higher order functions are functions which can take another function as an argument

Functions which can be supplied as arguments or returned from a function can be called *lambdas*

### Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code

Functional programming can make your code more manageable and less prone to bugs.

Functional programming is a form of declarative programming

Writing for-loops is a common task of imperative programming, JS has built in methods to handle such common tasks.
