# 11 Learn Nano by Building a Castle

## Introduction

Nano is a program which allows you to edit files right in the terminal.

## Building a castle

### Nano Basics

- I create castle.sh script in project folder:

        ~/project$ touch castle.sh

- I open the file with nano:

~/project$ nano castle.sh

- This opens the following in terminal:

        ![](2022-12-29-12-55-49.png)

- I wrote "echo nano" in the program and pressed ctrl+o to write to file

- I then exited nano using ctrl+x

- I run my script:

        ~/project$ bash castle.sh
            hello nano

- I delete echo nano from the script using the cursor and ctrl+k

- I then save and exit using ctrl+o

### Drawing a Castle:

- I echo someline breaks:

- I draw the ground level using 20 underscores:

    ![](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/11%20-%20Learn%20Nano%20by%20Building%20a%20Castle/screenshots/2022-12-29-13-01-58.png)]

- I exit nano using ctrl+x

- I execute my castle script again:

    ![](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/11%20-%20Learn%20Nano%20by%20Building%20a%20Castle/screenshots/2022-12-29-13-03-13.png)

- I add vertical bars around the ground floor:

- I add another story to the castle:

    ![](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/11%20-%20Learn%20Nano%20by%20Building%20a%20Castle/screenshots/2022-12-29-13-04-57.png)

- You can use ctrl+k to cut and ctrl+u to uncut or paste. I add five more stories to the castle:

- I make the roof for the castle:

- I add the lookout towers:

- Added peaks:

- Running the script:

    ![](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/11%20-%20Learn%20Nano%20by%20Building%20a%20Castle/screenshots/2022-12-29-13-16-47.png)

- I add two spaces to the right hand side of the slope of the tower:

    ![](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/11%20-%20Learn%20Nano%20by%20Building%20a%20Castle/screenshots/2022-12-29-13-19-58.png)

- Running the script:

    ![](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/11%20-%20Learn%20Nano%20by%20Building%20a%20Castle/screenshots/2022-12-29-13-20-37.png)

- Adding windows to fourth story:

    ![](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/11%20-%20Learn%20Nano%20by%20Building%20a%20Castle/screenshots/2022-12-29-13-22-53.png)

- Adding the door:

    ![](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/11%20-%20Learn%20Nano%20by%20Building%20a%20Castle/screenshots/2022-12-29-13-24-14.png)

- I add a message at the beginning of the castle script:

    ![](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/11%20-%20Learn%20Nano%20by%20Building%20a%20Castle/screenshots/2022-12-29-13-25-58.png)

- Finally, running the script:

    ![](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/11%20-%20Learn%20Nano%20by%20Building%20a%20Castle/screenshots/2022-12-29-13-26-32.png)
