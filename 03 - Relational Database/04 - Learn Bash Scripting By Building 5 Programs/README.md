# 4: Learn Bash Scripting by Building 5 Programs

In this tutorial, I created 5 bash scripts and learnt more about the Linux terminal.

## Programs:

1. [Questionnare](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/04%20-%20Learn%20Bash%20Scripting%20By%20Building%205%20Programs/Program%201%20-%20Questionnaire/)
2. [Countdown Timer](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/04%20-%20Learn%20Bash%20Scripting%20By%20Building%205%20Programs/Program%202%20-%20Countdown/)
3. [Bingo with Random Number Generation](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/04%20-%20Learn%20Bash%20Scripting%20By%20Building%205%20Programs/Program%203%20-%20Bingo/)
4. [Fortune Teller using Arrays, Functions and Regex](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/04%20-%20Learn%20Bash%20Scripting%20By%20Building%205%20Programs/Program%204%20-%20Fortune%20Teller/)
5. [Five - Executing bash scripts consecutively](/03%20-%20Relational%20Database/04%20-%20Learn%20Bash%20Scripting%20By%20Building%205%20Programs/Program%205%20-%20Five/)
