        <header>Encapsulation</header>
        <p>Encapsulation is a key design principle from object-oriented design<p>
        <p>Conceptually, it means classes should wrap data and methods which operate on its data within the class itself<p>
        <p>This is achieved by using access modifiers and making fields private, and getters/setters public<p>
        <code>class Anime {
          <br>
          &nbsp; private String title;
          <br>
          &nbsp; private Genre genre;
          <br>
          &nbsp; // public setters and getters
          <br>

        }
        </code>
        <p>Encapsulation achieves the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data-integrity</li>
          <li>Security
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="arrays">
        <header>Arrays</header>
        <p> Arrays are a funamental data structure in Java<p>
        <p> Arrays are ordered and have a fixed size<p>
        <p> Arrays is also an interface, it can be used to store primitives and objects<p>
        <code> int[] arr = new int[3] </code>
        <p>Arrays have the following properties:</p>    
        <ul>
          <li>They have fast read and write speeds</li>
          <li>You can get the size of an array using .lenght() method</li>
          <li> Each item of the array has an index which is required to retrieve the item</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="strings">
        <header>Strings</header>
        <p>Strings are an immutable data-structure in Java</p>
        <p>String literals are managed by the String Pool which is a stored in the Heap memory</p>
        <p>It is better for performance if we declare Strings as literals rather than using a String constructor</p>
        <code>String str = "Hello world!"</code>

      <section class="main-section"id="exceptions">
        <header>Exceptions</header>
        <p>Exceptions are a way of handling issues which may arrise during execution<p>
        <p>Exceptions are either thrown programatically or by the JVM </p>
        <p>We can handle exceptions using try/catch blocks </p>
    
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="polymorphism">
        <header>Polymorphism</header>
        <p>Polymorphism derives from a Greek word which means "many forms"<p>
        <p> Java supports Polymorphism; objects can be referenced by the class of the object OR a superclass of the object OR an interface of the class which it implements.<p>
        <p>Polymorphism consequentially allows for method overriding in which a method's implementation is dependent on the object which calls it<p>
        <code>
            class Fruits {};
            class Apple extends Fruite {};
            Fruits apple = new Apple(); // polymorphism
        </code>
