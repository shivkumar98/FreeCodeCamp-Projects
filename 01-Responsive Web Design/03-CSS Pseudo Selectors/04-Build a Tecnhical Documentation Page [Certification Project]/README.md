# Project 12: Build a Technical Page

In this project I will build a technical documentation page to serve as instruction or reference for a topic

**You can view the prerendered HTML of my solution [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/shivkumar98/FreeCodeCamp-Projects/blob/main/01-Responsive%20Web%20Design/03-CSS%20Pseudo%20Selectors/04-Build%20a%20Tecnhical%20Documentation%20Page%20%5BCertification%20Project%5D/V1/index.html)**

This page should have similar functionality as: https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks/#JavaScript_and_Java
