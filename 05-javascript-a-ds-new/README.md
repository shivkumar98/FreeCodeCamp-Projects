# Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (New)
* I completed the legacy version of this certification on 21/11/2022 ([view certification here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc55144a21-0a3a-4329-acd7-8e49b83d46f3/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures))
* I decided to regain this certification so I could consolidate my JavaScript knowledge and apply my experience from my job.
