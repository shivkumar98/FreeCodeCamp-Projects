// in the previous example, the original code used a splice method which was not coded correctly due to changes in the array as a result of splice()

// Change the below code for incremented function so it returns the value of the globalValue increased by 1

// The global variable
let fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer() {
  // Only change code below this line
  return fixedValue + 1;
  // Only change code above this line
}
