# Project 3: Building a Registration Form

I will attempt to recreate the end result of freecodeacdemy's third project (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-forms-by-building-a-registration-form/)

**View a preview of the rendered HTML [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/shivkumar98/FreeCodeCamp-Projects/blob/main/01%20-%20Responsive%20Web%20Design/01-HTML%20and%20CSS%20Basics/03-Building%20a%20Registration%20Form/V1/Registration%20Form.html)**
