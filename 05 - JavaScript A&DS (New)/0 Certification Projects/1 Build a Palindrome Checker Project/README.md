# 🚧 1 Build a Palindrome Checker Project

* **Objective**: Build an app that is functionally similar to [https://palindrome-checker.freecodecamp.rocks/](https://palindrome-checker.freecodecamp.rocks/)

## 📜 Instructions 📜

* A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
* Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

## 📖 User Stories 📖

3. You should have a `div`, `span`, or `p` element with an `id` of `"result"`
4. When you click on the `"#check-btn"` element without entering a value into the `#text-input` element, an alert should appear with the text `"Please input a value"`
5. When the `#text-input` element ony contains the letter `A` and the `#check-tn` element is clicked, the `#result` element should contain the text `"A is a palindrome"`
